# "*Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled*" Unnoficial API

*Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled* is the 2019 remake of the PS1 racing game *Crash Team Racing*, available for PS4, Xbox ONE and Switch.

CTR: NF has seasons called Grand Prix, which gives players challenges and rewards for completing those challenges by using a point system called Nitro. As of the creation of this API, the in game way of tracking those challenges is lacking, requiring the players to either write the challenges on paper to keep track of them between races or return to the main menu and go to a specific option to check them again.

This is an API project that aims to provide a quick way for developers to create tools to make it easier for CTR players to track down their Challenges, as well as check other info about the current Grand Prix, such as Leaderboards and needed Nitro for each prize.
